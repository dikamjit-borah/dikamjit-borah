### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Molia app, which has both [backend](https://github.com/dikamjit-borah/Molia-Backend) and [Android](https://github.com/dikamjit-borah/Molia-Android) components. This app allows users to create lists of their favorite movies and TV shows, as well as track what they are currently watching or create custom lists.
